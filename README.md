# Broadcast
Broadcast is a chatroom that will allow the viewers to 
view files together in a virtual theater setting. There will
be several additions to this application. The intended platform
of implementation is J2EE.

Worked on a way to get the movie viewer going. I still have to get the 
ground work for the stream to work.

I am using an API called JavaFx. It doesn't use as many image compression
files as I thought. I will have to find another or make my own.

Tonight I added the opencv api. This api has a .dll file that will 
allow access to the camera. The camera is working, I'm going ot have to
implement J2EE to send stream to peer computer. I also have to set up
the the JFrame design.
